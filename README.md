npm install tradingview-data
# yarn
yarn add tradingview-data
# pnpm
pnpm add tradingview-data
```

## Featuring

- brand-shiny-new typescript typings
- real-time data freshly ~~stolen~~ borrowed from TradingView's socket.io interface
- almost 100% success rate of ~~stealing~~ borrowing data
- 1:1 accuracy of ~~stolen~~ borrowed data _#confirmed_
- HTTP Origin header spoofing so nobody will notice anything suspicious
- okay, let's finally go into the _serious mode_, shall we?
